        <p>When I just got out of high school, I thought my passion was in front of the camaras as an actress. I saw on some of my friend's profiles on socila media this talent agentcy called "Seattle Talent" I went to the audition with some pictures from my senior photoshoot. They called me the next day to see if I wanted to be in Seatle Talent. I guess they called me first. They loved my pictures.</p>
        <p>I then found this site called "https://www.backstage.com/" I loved that site. I got like 50 -100 messages from different people. One was another talent agentcy. </p>
